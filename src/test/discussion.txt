1. Integration Tests:
  - run RD forward and compare result, constant and brain non-constant coefficients
  - run ME forward and compare result, brain non-constant coefficients
  - run MS forward and compare result, brain non-constant coefficients
  - run inverse L2, sinusoidal and brain non-const coefficients
  - run inverse sparse TIL, brain non-const coefficients
  - run inverse RD
  - run inverse ME

2. Unit Tests: e.g.,
  - forward solve, adjoint solve, advection solve 
  - objective function evaluation, gradient evaluation.
  - phi->apply
  - etc..
